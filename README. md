# Student Opportunity Hub

## Problem
As students, we often struggle to find internships, scholarships, hackathons, and learning opportunities because the information is spread across many different websites, WhatsApp groups, and social media pages.

Because of this:
- Many students miss deadlines  
- Information becomes confusing  
- Students from rural or non-metro areas do not get equal access to opportunities  

---

## Our Idea
Student Opportunity Hub is a simple web platform created to help students find all important opportunities in one place.

The main aim of this project is to:
- Save students’ time  
- Make opportunity discovery easier  
- Provide equal access to opportunities for all students

- List of internships, scholarships, hackathons, and courses  
- Category-wise browsing  
- Basic search option  
- Simple opportunity detail view  
- Clean and student-friendly interface

## How It Works (User Flow)
Student opens the website
Then the student views available opportunities
After that, the student uses category or search options
Next, the student checks opportunity details
Finally, the student applies using the provided link

🎓 Student Opportunity Hub


🧩 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to find internships, scholarships, hackathons, and learning opportunities because information is scattered across multiple websites, WhatsApp groups, and social media platforms.
As a result, many students miss deadlines and face confusion while searching for genuine opportunities.
